0	It doesn't make you look cool.
0	It doesn't work in Europe or Asia.

0	It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.
0	It felt too light and "tinny.".
0	It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.
0	It is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.
0	It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.
0	It is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap.
0	It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen.
0	It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.

0	it just thundered reallyreally loud at work and this little boy started crying  I wanted to cry too...I hate storms! wah
0	It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially d1.
0	It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.
0	It lasts less than 3o minutes, if I actually try to use the ph1.My wife has the same ph1 with the same problem.
0	It looses connection to the ph1 even when it is within a couple feet between the two.
0	It makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call.
0	It only recognizes the Ph1 as its storage device.
0	It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.
0	It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.
0	It should be illegal for me to date
0	it should be.. not a wink &gt;.&lt;
0	It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.
0	It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.
0	It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.
0	It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.
0	it was a drive to get there.
0	It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.
0	It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.
0	It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.

0	THAT 1 didn't work either.
0	That company is a joke.
0	That was d1 in the second movie.
0	That's a huge design flaw (unless I'm not using it correctly, which I don't think is the case).
0	That's how I'd describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film.
0	thatdude356 some1 hates me
0	thatgirlonline Dude you're always going to midnight screenings! xD. I wish I lived in a city. Well, I do (until tmrw!) but it's rubbish
0	The "explosion" of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful.
0	The &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; DVD that I rented from Blockbuster.com yesterday was cracked. Figured it out about 35 minutes into the movie.
0	The 1 big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the ph1's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds.
0	The 1 down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.
0	The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.
0	The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.
0	The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that's how bad it is.
0	The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.
0	The acting sucked.
0	The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.
0	The acting was bad.
0	The acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period Universal B movie.
0	The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.
0	The ambiance isn't much better.
0	The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.
0	The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by every1 who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.
0	The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.
0	The battery is completely useless to me.
0	The battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena.
0	The battery life is highly unacceptable.
0	The battery runs down quickly.
0	The best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.
0	The best thing about Ciara. She just finished singing!
0	The biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast.
0	The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (1 minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.
0	The bottowm line...another worthless, cheap gimmick from Sprint.
0	The BT headset was such a disapoinment.
0	The Bucket List was a very bad film choice this evening.  I may need therapy now
0	The budget was evidently very limited.
0	The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.
0	The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.
0	The building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.
0	the building was FREEZING cold.
0	The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.
0	The burger... I got the "Gold Standard" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed.
0	The Burrittos Blah!
0	The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.
0	The buttons for on and off are bad.
0	The cable looks so thin and flimsy, it is scary.
0	The calls drop, the ph1 comes on and off at will, the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently.
0	The camera on the ph1 may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.
0	The camera, although rated at an impressive 1.3 megapixels, renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution.
0	The case for my iPod Touch is literally falling apart.  So junk
0	The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.
0	The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.
0	The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.
0	The casting is also horrible, cause all you see is a really really BAD Actors, period.
0	The CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God's sake!
0	The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily.
0	The character developments also lacked in depth.
0	The charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work.
0	the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my ph1.
0	The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.
0	The chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok, the wedges were cold and soggy.
0	The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.
0	The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.
0	The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.
0	The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.
0	The commercials are the most misleading.
0	The concert sequences just sucked.
0	The construction of the headsets is poor.
0	The dark side of a selfie.
0	The death row scenes were entirely unmoving.
0	The descriptions said "yum yum sauce" and another said "eel sauce", yet another said "spicy mayo"...well N1 of the rolls had sauces on them.
0	The design is very odd, as the ear "clip" is not very comfortable at all.
0	The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.
0	The desserts were a bit strange.
0	The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.
0	The dialogue sucked.
0	The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.
0	The directing is sloppy at best.
0	The directing seems too pretentious.
0	The ear buds only play music in 1 ear.
0	The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.
0	The fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors
0	The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.
0	The film has an ultra-cheap look to it.
0	The film is way too long.
0	The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.
0	The film looks cheap and bland.
0	The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.
0	The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.
0	The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.
0	The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all.
0	the food is not tasty at all, not to say its "real traditional Hunan style".
0	The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.
0	The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.
0	The food was terrible.
0	The food was terrible.
0	The food wasn't good.
0	The football scenes at the end were perplexing.
0	The Foreigner is not worth 1 second of your time.
0	The fried rice was dry as well.
0	The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.
0	The guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.
0	The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.
0	The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad.
0	The instruction manual is lacking.
0	The instructions didn't explain that a microph1 jack could be used.
0	The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked.
0	The item received was Counterfeit.
0	The jerky camera movements were also annoying.
0	The jetway feels like the seventh layer of hell. Oh and there are way too many babies on this flight. And I forgot my Bose.
0	The kids are annoying.
0	The kids play area is NASTY!
0	The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.
0	The lead man is charisma-free.
0	The least said about the acting the better.
0	The lighting is awful.
0	The lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong.
0	The live music on Fridays totally blows.
0	The loudspeaker option is great, the bumpers with the lights is very ... appealing.
0	The majority of the Logitech earbud headsets failed.
0	The management is rude.
0	The manager was the worst.
0	The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.
0	The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.
0	The mic there is a joke, and the volume is quite low.
0	The more I hear you, the more annoyed I get
0	The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal.
0	The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.
0	the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.
0	The movie is terribly boring in places.
0	The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.
0	The movie seemed a little slow at first.
0	The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!
0	The nano stated it.My son was dissapointed.
0	The new characters weren't all that memorable, and I found myself forgetting who was who.
0	The new resigned cricinfo : http://tinyurl.com/mxlcuvI hate change
0	The new tecas driver license design is ugly
0	The Ngage is still lacking in earbuds.
0	The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my ph1.
0	The only downside is the service.
0	The only place good for this film is in the garbage.
0	The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.
0	The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.
0	The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.
0	The only thing about preparing 5 sermons in 1 week is just when you think you are d1...you have to prepare the powerpoint slides
0	The only thing I hate about Playoff Pens hockey is how much the tickets are! I wanted to go to a game but there 300$ a ticket
0	The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it pur?ed.
0	The only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda).
0	The only thing that I think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset.
0	The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing.
0	the only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPH1!!!!
0	The only way I'll feel safe is when he's finally in jail where his stalker ass belongs!
0	THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not 1!
0	The painting is ugly, will return it tomorrow...
0	The pan cakes every1 are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.
0	The ph1 crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.
0	The ph1 gets EXTREMELY HOT!
0	The ph1 takes FOREVER to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally.
0	the ph1 was unusable and was not new.
0	The picture resolution is far below what other comparably-priced ph1s are offering today.
0	The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.
0	The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.
0	The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!
0	The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted.
0	The plastic breaks really easy on this clip.
0	The pleather case doesn't fit.
0	The plot - well, I said I'd let that 1 go.
0	The plot doesn't hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling.
0	The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.
0	The plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it.
0	The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.
0	The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.
0	The plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.
0	The plug did not work very well.
0	The poor actors.
0	The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.
0	The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.
0	The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.
0	the presentation of the food was awful.
0	The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).
0	The problem was the script.
0	The real disappointment was our waiter.
0	The real killer is the volume, and of course it breaking.
0	The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.
0	The replacement died in a few weeks.
0	The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.
0	The result is a film that just don't look right.
0	The results, well, are a shame.
0	The RI style calamari was a joke.
0	The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.
0	The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.
0	The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.
0	The scenes with the "oh-so-mature" neighbour-girl are a misplace.
0	The screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face.
0	The script is a big flawed mess.
0	The script is bad, very bad ? it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated R or NC-17 movie.
0	The script is?was there a script
0	The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.
0	The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.
0	The selection of food was not the best.
0	The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was n1.
0	The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!
0	The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.
0	The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an "Are you being helped "
0	The service here is fair at best.
0	The service here leaves a lot to be desired.

0	The service was poor and thats being nice.
0	The service was terrible though.
0	The service was terrible, food was mediocre.
0	The sets are so bad, they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.
0	The show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.
0	The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for every1 to see!
0	The sound quality for the device is unacceptable.Unless you are in a really quiet area, you almost hear nothing.
0	The soundtrack sucked.
0	the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.
0	The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring t1s sound very cheap.
0	The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no 1 even says hi for the first 10 minutes.
0	The stories were as unbelievable as the actors.
0	The story is beyond stupid.
0	The story line is just awful!
0	The story line is totally predictable.
0	THE SUN IS SHINING&lt; THE SKY IS FACKING BLUE&lt; TELETUBBIES  I HAVE TO FUCKING WORK.

0	The Taxi Q at Pelangi was super loooong.. and now I'm getting headaches because of the hot-cold transition
0	The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.
0	The toaster oven was my fault. Now I'm going to look like an idiot in front of my father.
0	The trains turned into a microwave
0	The turkey and roast beef were bland.
0	The ugliest car ever!
0	The update procedure is difficult and cumbersome.
0	The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.
0	The visual effects were AWFUL.
0	The volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown.
0	The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.
0	The warm beer didn't help.
0	The weather is gross outside. It puts me in a bad mood.
0	The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.

0	Their network coverage in Los Angeles is horrible.
0	Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the ph1 while in use.
0	Then back to fucking school
0	Then I exchanged for the same ph1, even that had the same problem.
0	Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.
0	Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.
0	Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.
0	Then the film just dropped the ball.
0	Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.
0	thenk83 I've been waiting about the same time to get in, its whenever they feel like it...
0	ThePaul it's a modded 360, so you can't send it back   That Red Ring of Death sucks!  It took weeks to get mine back from Microsoft.
0	There are bugs attacking my laptop
0	There are many continuity errors: 1 other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses...the 1 that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene.

0	There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.
0	There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better
0	There is simply no excuse for something this poorly d1.
0	There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.
0	There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot.
0	There was hardly any meat.
0	There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.
0	There was NOTHING believable about it at all.
0	There was so much hype over this ph1 that I assumed it was the best, my mistake.
0	There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.
0	There were too many close ups.
0	There's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that I have never experienced before.
0	There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.
0	There's really nothing bad I can say about this headset.
0	These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.
0	These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet.

0	They refuse to refund or replace.
0	they tryna get me 2 sing on mic n i said NO
0	They work about 2 weeks then break.
0	They wouldn't reverse any of my overdraft fees.
